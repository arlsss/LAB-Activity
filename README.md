Introduction of Menu App
	A menu is a visual interface element that presents a list of options or commands for you to choose from. It helps you navigate through a software application or website by providing a structured way to access different functionalities.
Describe the Menu App
	A menu program is a program that displays options to the user and allows them to make choices based on their input. Menu programs are often used in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) as a way to give users control over the program.
